# Tixati-Magnet-URI-association-fix
An association fix for tixati not appearing as a selectable default app, Magnet URI and .magnet file. 

If you want to use this you need to change paths if your install location differs from mine. 
I would suggest you open the .reg file in a text editor that shows the respective number of lines and edit these specified lines: 14, 22, 29, 40, 48, 63. replace my tixati's .exe location with yours and you are set. 

it should then look like this in windows: <img width="1357" height="516" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/142cf1de-899e-4999-8f15-a241b138af07" />


if you want to use other programs like uTorrent, BitTorrent, etc. you need to change the names and labels as well.

also use double backslash '\\' instead of single otherwise it will not work.

when in doubt ask and you shall receive (if I'm available ofc)

to recap:
1) unzip
2) open in text editor
3) change paths
4) *OPTIONAL* change names and labels
5) save and double click
